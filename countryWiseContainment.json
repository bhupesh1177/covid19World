The reagents cost around Rs 17,000 per test and need to be bought in bulk, sufficient for about 200 tests. As there were no other suspected cases needing testing, the officials decided to send the samples to Hong Kong instead of buying the reagents. The samples were sent to Hong Kong on 21 January. On 24 January, the Health ministry confirmed that the test had come back positive. The ministry said the patient was under surveillance, those who came into close contact with him were being investigated, and health information on all passengers returning from China was being sought. However, The Kathmandu Post quoted officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Disease as saying that no one knew of the patient's activity since he was discharged and that they were looking for him. Later, they said that they had only spoken to the patient on phone; he had reported being in good health and was not asked to come in for check-up or monitoring. The patient was confirmed completely treated when RT-PCR throat swabs returned negative for COVID-19 in followup assessments of 29 and 31 January.
